## Build and Flash

1. **Compile** the configuration:
   ```bash
   esphome compile your_config.yaml
   ```

2. **Flash** to your device:
   ```bash
   esphome upload your_config.yaml
   ```

3. **Monitor** the logs to verify it's working:
   ```bash
   esphome logs your_config.yaml
   ```

## Verify in Home Assistant

Once your device is running:

1. Open Home Assistant
2. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **BTHome**
3. Your device should appear automatically
4. Click **Configure** to add it

You should now see your temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors in Home Assistant!
