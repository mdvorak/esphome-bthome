---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Prerequisites

- ESPHome 2024.1.0 or later
- ESP32 or nRF52840 board
- Home Assistant with BTHome integration (for receiving data)

## Installation Methods

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Git (Recommended)">
    Add the component directly from GitHub in your ESPHome configuration:

    ```yaml
    external_components:
      - source:
          type: git
          url: https://github.com/dz0ny/esphome-bthome
          ref: main
        components: [bthome]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Local">
    Clone the repository and reference it locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dz0ny/esphome-bthome.git
    ```

    Then in your ESPHome configuration:

    ```yaml
    external_components:
      - source:
          type: local
          path: /path/to/esphome-bthome/components
        components: [bthome]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Verify Installation

After adding the external component, ESPHome will automatically download and compile the BTHome component when you build your configuration.

To verify the installation is working:

1. Create a minimal configuration (see [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start))
2. Compile the configuration: `esphome compile your_config.yaml`
3. Check for any errors in the output

## Home Assistant Setup

To receive BTHome broadcasts in Home Assistant:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **BTHome**
4. Follow the setup wizard

Home Assistant will automatically discover BTHome devices broadcasting nearby.

:::tip
Make sure your Home Assistant host has Bluetooth capability, either built-in or via a USB Bluetooth adapter.
