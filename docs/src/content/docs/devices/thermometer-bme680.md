title: Thermometer (BME680)
description: Battery-powered environmental sensor with temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas
---

A comprehensive environmental sensor using BME680 that broadcasts temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality via BTHome.

## Hardware

- Seeed XIAO BLE (nRF52840)
- BME680 sensor module (I2C)
- 3.7V LiPo battery

## Sensor Specifications

| Measurement | Range | Accuracy |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Temperature | -40 to +85°C | ±1.0°C |
| Humidity | 0 to 100% | ±3% |
| Pressure | 300 to 1100 hPa | ±1 hPa |
| Gas | VOC detection | Relative |

## Power Consumption

| State | Current |
|-------|---------|
| Deep sleep | ~3µA |
| Sensor reading | ~12mA |
| BLE TX | ~15mA |

**Expected battery life**: 3-6 months with 400mAh battery (5min intervals)

:::tip[Extend Battery Life]
Increase `sleep_duration` to 15min or 30min for sensors where real-time data isn't critical.
