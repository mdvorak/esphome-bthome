title: Water Meter (Pulse Counter)
description: Battery-powered water usage monitor using pulse counter
---

A water consumption monitor that counts pulses from a water meter and broadcasts usage via BTHome.

## Hardware

- Seeed XIAO BLE (nRF52840)
- Water meter with pulse output (reed switch or Hall effect)
- 3.7V LiPo battery

Common water meters output 1 pulse per liter or 1 pulse per 10 liters.

## Wiring

| Water Meter | XIAO Pin |
|-------------|----------|
| Pulse output | D2 (pin 2) |
| GND | GND |

Most water meter pulse outputs are open-drain/open-collector, so we use the internal pull-up.

## Configuration

```yaml

  name: water-meter
  friendly_name: Water Meter

    - type: water

      id: water_pulses

# No deep sleep - need to count pulses continuously
# For battery operation, consider a supercapacitor backup
```

## Configuration for 10L/pulse Meters

If your water meter outputs 1 pulse per 10 liters:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: pulse_counter
    pin:
      number: 2
      mode: INPUT_PULLUP
    id: water_pulses
    name: "Water Flow"
    unit_of_measurement: "L/min"
    update_interval: 60s
    filters:
      - multiply: 10.0  # Each pulse = 10 liters
    total:
      id: water_total_pulses
      name: "Water Pulses Total"
      filters:
        - multiply: 10.0
```

## Battery Considerations

:::caution[Continuous Operation Required]
Unlike other sensors, water meters require continuous pulse counting. Deep sleep is **not recommended** as pulses would be missed.
:::

For battery operation, consider:

1. **USB power** when possible
2. **Solar panel** with battery backup
3. **Large battery** (2000mAh+) with reduced TX power

```yaml
bthome:
  tx_power: -4  # Reduce power to extend battery
  min_interval: 60s
  max_interval: 120s
```

## Meter Types

| Meter Type | Typical Output | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Residential | 1 pulse/L | Most common |
| Industrial | 1 pulse/10L | Higher flow |
| Garden | 1 pulse/L | Brass body |
| Plastic inline | 1 pulse/L | Budget option |

## Power Consumption

| State | Current |
|-------|---------|
| Idle (counting) | ~3mA |
| BLE TX | ~15mA |

**Expected battery life**: 1-2 months with 2000mAh battery (no sleep)

:::tip[Extend Battery Life]
Use a solar panel or connect to USB power for continuous operation. Battery-only is suitable for short-term monitoring.
