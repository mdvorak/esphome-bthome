description: Using BTHome with ESP32 boards
---

The BTHome component fully supports ESP32 boards using the ESP-IDF framework.

## Supported Boards

Any ESP32 board with Bluetooth LE support:
- ESP32 (original)
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-S3
- ESP32-C6

## Basic Configuration

```yaml
esphome:
  name: bthome-esp32
  friendly_name: BTHome ESP32

esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

logger:

external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/dz0ny/esphome-bthome
      ref: main
    components: [bthome]
```

## Framework Requirement

BTHome requires the **ESP-IDF** framework (not Arduino):

```yaml
esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  framework:
    type: esp-idf  # Required!
```

:::caution
Arduino framework is not supported. You must use ESP-IDF.

## TX Power Levels

ESP32 supports these transmit power levels:

| Setting | Power | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| -12 | -12 dBm | Minimum, ~1m range |
| -9 | -9 dBm | Very low |
| -6 | -6 dBm | Low |
| -3 | -3 dBm | Below default |
| 0 | 0 dBm | Default |
| 3 | +3 dBm | Above default |
| 6 | +6 dBm | High |
| 9 | +9 dBm | Maximum, ~30m+ range |

```yaml
bthome:
  tx_power: 6  # High power for longer range
```

## Complete Example

Temperature, humidity, and motion sensor:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: bthome-esp32
  friendly_name: BTHome ESP32 Sensor

esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

logger:

external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/dz0ny/esphome-bthome
      ref: main
    components: [bthome]

```

## Power Optimization

For battery-powered ESP32 devices:

### Use Deep Sleep

```yaml
deep_sleep:
  run_duration: 10s
  sleep_duration: 5min
```

### Reduce TX Power

```yaml
bthome:
  tx_power: -6  # Lower power saves battery
```

### Increase Advertising Interval

```yaml
bthome:
  min_interval: 30s
  max_interval: 60s
```

## Troubleshooting

### BLE not initializing

Ensure you're using ESP-IDF framework:
```yaml
esp32:
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
```

### Short range

Increase TX power:
```yaml
bthome:
  tx_power: 9  # Maximum
```

### High power consumption

Reduce advertising frequency and TX power:
```yaml
bthome:
  min_interval: 30s
  max_interval: 60s
  tx_power: -3
```
