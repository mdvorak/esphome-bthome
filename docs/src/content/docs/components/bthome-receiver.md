title: BTHome Receiver
description: Receive BTHome v2 BLE advertisements from external devices
---

The **BTHome Receiver** component allows your ESP32 to receive and decode BTHome v2 BLE advertisements from external devices. This enables your ESPHome device to act as a BTHome gateway, collecting sensor data from multiple BTHome-compatible devices.

## Features

- Receives BTHome v2 BLE advertisements from external devices
- Supports 60+ sensor types (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.)
- Supports 28 binary sensor types (motion, door, window, etc.)
- Supports text sensors for UTF-8 strings and raw binary data
- AES-128-CCM encryption support with replay protection
- Button and dimmer event triggers for automation
- Multiple device support with individual configurations
- Optional per-device encryption keys
- **Two BLE stack options**: Bluedroid (default) or NimBLE (lightweight)
- **Discovery mode**: Log all BTHome advertisements to find devices and debug configurations

## BLE Stack Selection

The BTHome Receiver supports two different BLE stacks: **Bluedroid** (default) and **NimBLE**. The choice of stack affects memory usage, features, and compatibility.

### Bluedroid Stack (Default)

The default BLE stack for ESP32. Use this when:
- You need compatibility with other ESPHome BLE components (`esp32_ble_tracker`, `bluetooth_proxy`, etc.)
- You want to use BLE for multiple purposes (scanning, connections, etc.)
- You're already using the `esp32_ble` component

```yaml
esp32_ble_tracker:
  scan_parameters:
    active: false

bthome_receiver:
  ble_stack: bluedroid  # Default, can be omitted
  devices:
    - mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
```

### NimBLE Stack

A lightweight, standalone BLE stack optimized for observer-only scenarios. Choose NimBLE when:
- **Memory is limited** - Saves approximately 253KB flash and 10KB RAM
- **Receiving only** - Your device only needs to receive BTHome advertisements
- **No other BLE features needed** - You don't need BLE scanning for other purposes or connections
- **Battery-powered devices** - Smaller footprint means less power consumption

```yaml
bthome_receiver:
  ble_stack: nimble
  devices:
    - mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
```

:::tip[Memory Savings]
NimBLE can free up significant resources on memory-constrained devices, making room for more features or reducing overall power consumption.
:::

:::caution[NimBLE Limitations]
NimBLE is **standalone** and cannot coexist with other ESPHome BLE components like `esp32_ble`, `esp32_ble_tracker`, or `bluetooth_proxy`. If your configuration uses any of these components, you must use the default Bluedroid stack.

### Stack Comparison

Actual measurements from BTHome receiver on ESP32-S3:

| Feature | Bluedroid | NimBLE | Savings |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Flash Usage | 1,151KB (62.7%) | 898KB (48.9%) | **~253KB** |
| RAM Usage | 50KB (15.3%) | 40KB (12.3%) | **~10KB** |
| BLE Scanning | Via esp32_ble_tracker | Built-in passive | - |
| Compatible with esp32_ble | Yes | No | - |
| Compatible with bluetooth_proxy | Yes | No | - |
| Best For | Multi-function BLE | Receive-only gateway | - |

## Discovery Mode

Before configuring specific devices, you can enable **discovery mode** to find all BTHome devices in range and see what data they're broadcasting. This is useful for:

- Finding MAC addresses of new devices
- Identifying what sensor types a device broadcasts
- Debugging encrypted devices (shows if encryption is enabled)
- Getting ready-to-use YAML configuration snippets

### Enabling Discovery Mode

```yaml
bthome_receiver:
  dump_advertisements: true
```

### Log Output

When enabled, all BTHome advertisements are logged with parsed sensor data:

```

## Encryption

To receive encrypted BTHome advertisements, specify the 16-byte AES-128 key as 32 hexadecimal characters.

### Method 1: Hub-Level Configuration

Register the device and encryption key in the hub:

```yaml
bthome_receiver:
  devices:
    - mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
      name: "Secure Sensor"
      encryption_key: "231d39c1d7cc1ab1aee224cd096db932"

sensor:
  - platform: bthome_receiver
    mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
    temperature:
      name: "Secure Temperature"
```

### Method 2: Platform-Level Configuration

Specify the encryption key directly in each platform configuration:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: bthome_receiver
    mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
    encryption_key: "231d39c1d7cc1ab1aee224cd096db932"
    temperature:
      name: "Secure Temperature"
    humidity:
      name: "Secure Humidity"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: bthome_receiver
    mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
    encryption_key: "231d39c1d7cc1ab1aee224cd096db932"
    motion:
      name: "Secure Motion"
```

:::note
The component automatically handles replay protection by tracking packet counters for encrypted devices.
:::

## Event Triggers

The BTHome receiver supports automation triggers for button and dimmer events.

### Button Events

Button events support multiple press types:

```yaml
bthome_receiver:
  devices:
    - mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
      name: "Smart Button"
      on_button:
        - button_index: 0
          event: "press"
          then:
            - light.toggle: living_room_light
        - button_index: 0
          event: "double_press"
          then:
            - scene.apply: movie_mode
        - button_index: 0
          event: "long_press"
          then:
            - light.turn_off: all_lights
```

#### Supported Button Events

- `none` (0x00) - No event
- `press` (0x01) - Single press
- `double_press` (0x02) - Double press
- `triple_press` (0x03) - Triple press
- `long_press` (0x04) - Long press
- `long_double_press` (0x05) - Long double press
- `long_triple_press` (0x06) - Long triple press
- `hold_press` (0x80) - Hold/continuous press

### Dimmer Events

Dimmer events provide step values for brightness control:

```yaml
bthome_receiver:
  devices:
    - mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
      name: "Smart Dimmer"
      on_dimmer:
        - then:
            - light.dim_relative:
                id: living_room_light
                relative_brightness: !lambda 'return steps * 0.05;'
```

The `steps` variable contains the dimmer step count (positive for increase, negative for decrease).

```yaml
sensor:
  # Device 1
  - platform: bthome_receiver
    mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
    temperature:
      name: "Sensor 1 Temperature"

  # Device 2
  - platform: bthome_receiver
    mac_address: "11:22:33:44:55:66"
    temperature:
      name: "Sensor 2 Temperature"

  # Device 3 (encrypted)
  - platform: bthome_receiver
    mac_address: "77:88:99:AA:BB:CC"
    encryption_key: "231d39c1d7cc1ab1aee224cd096db932"
    temperature:
      name: "Sensor 3 Temperature"
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use discovery mode first** - Enable `dump_advertisements: true` to find devices and see their sensor types before configuring
2. **Use encryption** for sensitive data or devices accessible in public areas
3. **Register devices in the hub** when using event triggers or hub-level encryption
4. **Monitor battery levels** by including the `battery` sensor for battery-powered devices
5. **BLE Scanner range** - Keep devices within 10-30 meters depending on environment
6. **Scan parameters** - Use `active: false` in `esp32_ble_tracker` for better compatibility
7. **Packet deduplication** - The receiver automatically handles duplicate packets using packet IDs
8. **Disable discovery mode** after configuring devices to reduce log output and save resources

## Troubleshooting

### Device not discovered

- **Enable discovery mode** by setting `dump_advertisements: true` to see all BTHome devices in range
- Verify the MAC address is correct (check the dump output or use a BLE scanner app)
- Ensure the device is within BLE range (typically 10-30 meters)
- For Bluedroid: Check that `esp32_ble_tracker` is configured and running
- Verify the device is broadcasting BTHome v2 advertisements (UUID 0xFCD2)

### Encrypted data not decrypted

- Enable `dump_advertisements: true` to confirm the device is encrypted (look for "Encrypted: yes")
- Verify the encryption key matches the broadcasting device (32 hex characters)
- Check that the key is correctly formatted (no spaces or dashes)
- Ensure the device is broadcasting with encryption enabled (device info byte should be 0x41)

### Missing sensor values

- Enable `dump_advertisements: true` to see exactly what sensor types the device broadcasts
- Verify the sensor type name matches what the device is broadcasting (check the object ID)
- Check the ESPHome logs for decoding errors
- Ensure the object ID in the advertisement matches the configured sensor type
