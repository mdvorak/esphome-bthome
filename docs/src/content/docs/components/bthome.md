title: BTHome Component
description: Configuration reference for the BTHome component
---

The BTHome component is the core of BTHome for ESPHome, providing BLE broadcasting capabilities for ESP32 and nRF52 platforms.

## Platform Support

| Platform | BLE Stack | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| ESP32, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3 | Bluedroid (default) | Supported |
| ESP32, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3 | NimBLE | Supported |
| nRF52840 | Zephyr BT | Supported |

## BLE Stack Selection (ESP32 Only)

ESP32 platforms support two different BLE stacks: **Bluedroid** (default) and **NimBLE**. The choice of stack affects memory usage, features, and compatibility.

### Bluedroid Stack

The default BLE stack for ESP32. Use this when:
- You need compatibility with other ESPHome BLE components (`esp32_ble_tracker`, `bluetooth_proxy`, etc.)
- You're already using the `esp32_ble` component
- You need full BLE functionality (scanning, connections, etc.)

```yaml
bthome:
  ble_stack: bluedroid  # Default, can be omitted
```

### NimBLE Stack

A lightweight, standalone BLE stack optimized for broadcast-only scenarios. Choose NimBLE when:
- **Memory is limited** - Saves approximately 170KB flash and 100KB RAM
- **Broadcasting only** - Your device only needs to send BTHome advertisements
- **No other BLE features needed** - You don't need BLE scanning or connections
- **Battery-powered devices** - Smaller footprint means less power consumption

```yaml
bthome:
  ble_stack: nimble
```

:::tip[Memory Savings]
NimBLE can free up significant resources on memory-constrained devices, making room for more features or reducing overall power consumption.
:::

:::caution[NimBLE Limitations]
NimBLE is **standalone** and cannot coexist with other ESPHome BLE components like `esp32_ble`, `esp32_ble_tracker`, or `bluetooth_proxy`. If your configuration uses any of these components, you must use the default Bluedroid stack.
:::

### Stack Comparison

Actual measurements from CPU temperature sensor example on ESP32-S3:

| Feature | Bluedroid | NimBLE | Savings |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Flash Usage | 1,101KB (60%) | 886KB (48%) | **~215KB** |
| RAM Usage | 47KB (14.3%) | 40KB (12.2%) | **~7KB** |
| Broadcasting | Yes | Yes | - |
| Scanning | Yes | No | - |
| Connections | Yes | No | - |
| Encryption Library | mbedtls | tinycrypt | ~7KB |
| Compatible with esp32_ble | Yes | No | - |
| Compatible with bluetooth_proxy | Yes | No | - |
| Best For | Multi-function BLE | Broadcast-only sensors | - |

:::tip[Real-World Savings]
In our tests, NimBLE saved **215KB flash** and **7KB RAM** compared to Bluedroid - that's nearly 20% of total flash space freed up for other features!
:::

### Supported Devices

NimBLE is available on:
- ESP32 (original)
- ESP32-S3
- ESP32-C3

Other ESP32 variants (ESP32-S2, ESP32-C6) may have varying support depending on ESP-IDF version.

## Measurement Rotation (Multi-Packet Support)

BLE advertisements have a maximum payload of 31 bytes. For devices with many sensors (like weather stations), not all measurements may fit in a single packet. The BTHome component automatically handles this with **measurement rotation**.

### How It Works

When sensors don't all fit in one packet, the component:

1. **Fills the packet** with as many measurements as will fit
2. **Rotates** to the next set of measurements on the next advertisement
3. **Cycles through** all sensors over multiple advertisements

For example, with 8 sensors where only 4 fit per packet:
- First advertisement: Sensors 0, 1, 2, 3
- Second advertisement: Sensors 4, 5, 6, 7
- Third advertisement: Sensors 0, 1, 2, 3 (cycle repeats)

### Receiver Compatibility

The BTHome mobile app and other receivers automatically merge measurements from multiple packets by sensor type. This means:
- All sensor values are visible in the app
- Values update as each packet arrives
- No configuration needed on the receiver side

### Weather Station Example

```yaml
esphome:
  name: weather-station
  friendly_name: Weather Station

esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/dz0ny/esphome-bthome
      ref: main
    components: [bthome]

i2c:
  sda: GPIO21
  scl: GPIO22

sensor:
  # BME680 - 4 measurements
  - platform: bme680
    temperature:
      id: temperature
      name: "Temperature"
    humidity:
      id: humidity
      name: "Humidity"
    pressure:
      id: pressure
      name: "Pressure"
    gas_resistance:
      id: gas
      name: "Gas Resistance"
    update_interval: 60s

  # Additional sensors
  - platform: adc
    pin: GPIO34
    id: uv_index
    name: "UV Index"

  - platform: pulse_counter
    pin: GPIO25
    id: wind_speed
    name: "Wind Speed"

# BTHome broadcasts all sensors with automatic rotation
bthome:
  ble_stack: nimble
  min_interval: 5s
  max_interval: 10s
  sensors:
    - type: temperature
      id: temperature
    - type: humidity
      id: humidity
    - type: pressure
      id: pressure
    - type: tvoc
      id: gas
    - type: uv_index
      id: uv_index
    - type: speed
      id: wind_speed
```

:::tip[Advertisement Interval]
With measurement rotation, set shorter intervals (5-10s) so all sensors are broadcast within a reasonable time. If you have 8 sensors split across 2 packets, a 5s interval means all data is sent every 10s.
:::

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to see rotation in action:

```
[D][bthome:426]: Built advertisement data (27 bytes)
[D][bthome:429]:   Sensor rotation: starting from index 0/6
[D][bthome:438]:   ADV: 02 01 06 14 16 D2 FC 40 02 E8 03 03 C2 1E 04 ...
```

The log shows which sensor index the current packet starts from and how many total sensors exist.

## Button and Dimmer Events

The BTHome component supports sending button and dimmer events, following the [BTHome v2 specification](https://bthome.io/format/). These events are useful for creating remote controls, switches, and dimmer controllers.

### Button Events

Button events allow you to send various button press types to receivers. The BTHome v2 spec uses **multiple sequential 0x3A objects** to represent multiple buttons, where the order determines the button index.

#### Supported Event Types

- `0x00` - None (no event, used for multi-button advertisements)
- `0x01` - Press (single press)
- `0x02` - Double press
- `0x03` - Triple press
- `0x04` - Long press
- `0x05` - Long double press
- `0x06` - Long triple press
- `0x80` - Hold press (continuous press)

#### Single Button Events

Use `send_button_event(button_index, event_type)` to send an event for a single button:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO0
    name: "Button 0"
    on_press:
      then:
        - lambda: |-
            // Send button 0 press event
            id(bthome_broadcaster)->send_button_event(0, 0x01);
    
    on_multi_click:
      - timing:
          - ON for at most 1s
          - OFF for at most 1s
          - ON for at most 1s
          - OFF for at least 0.2s
        then:
          - lambda: |-
              // Send button 0 double press event
              id(bthome_broadcaster)->send_button_event(0, 0x02);

  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO1
    name: "Button 1"
    on_press:
      then:
        - lambda: |-
            // Send button 1 press event
            id(bthome_broadcaster)->send_button_event(1, 0x01);
```

#### Multiple Button Events

Use `send_button_events(vector<uint8_t>)` to send events for multiple buttons in a single advertisement:

```yaml
api:
  services:
    - service: send_multi_button_events
      variables:
        button0_event: int
        button1_event: int
      then:
        - lambda: |-
            // Send events for multiple buttons
            // Order determines button index: [button 0, button 1]
            std::vector<uint8_t> events = {
              (uint8_t)button0_event,
              (uint8_t)button1_event
            };
            id(bthome_broadcaster)->send_button_events(events);
```

**Examples:**
- Button 0 press, Button 1 double press: `{0x01, 0x02}`
- Only Button 1 press (Button 0 none): `{0x00, 0x01}`
- Both buttons pressed: `{0x01, 0x01}`

### Dimmer Events

Dimmer events send signed steps for brightness or volume control:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rotary_encoder
    name: "Rotary Encoder"
    id: rotary
    pin_a: GPIO2
    pin_b: GPIO3
    on_value:
      then:
        - lambda: |-
            static float last_value = 0;
            float delta = x - last_value;
            last_value = x;
            
            // Send dimmer event: positive=increase, negative=decrease
            int8_t steps = (int8_t)delta;
            if (steps != 0) {
              id(bthome_broadcaster)->send_dimmer_event(steps);
            }
```

**Event Values:**
- Positive values (1-127): Increase brightness/volume
- Negative values (-128 to -1): Decrease brightness/volume

### BTHome v2 Spec Compliance

The implementation follows the official BTHome v2 specification:
- Multiple buttons are represented by multiple sequential `0x3A` objects
- The order of objects determines button index (0=first, 1=second, etc.)
- Special event `0x00` (None) can be used when only some buttons have events
- See: [BTHome Format Reference](https://bthome.io/format/)

## Migration Guide

### From Bluedroid to NimBLE

If you have an existing BTHome configuration using Bluedroid and want to switch to NimBLE:

1. **Check for conflicts** - Remove any incompatible components:
   - `esp32_ble` or `esp32_ble_tracker`
   - `bluetooth_proxy`
   - Any other components that use BLE scanning or connections

2. **Add ble_stack option**:
   ```yaml
   bthome:
     ble_stack: nimble  # Add this line
     # ... rest of your config
   ```

3. **Recompile and flash** - The firmware will be smaller and use less RAM

### From NimBLE to Bluedroid

If you need to add BLE scanning or other features:

1. **Change or remove ble_stack**:
   ```yaml
   bthome:
     ble_stack: bluedroid  # Or omit this line entirely
     # ... rest of your config
   ```

2. **Add required components** - Now you can use `esp32_ble`, `bluetooth_proxy`, etc.

3. **Recompile and flash**

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with NimBLE

**Symptom**: Compilation errors related to NimBLE headers or configuration.

**Solution**: Ensure you're using ESP-IDF framework (not Arduino):
```yaml
esp32:
  framework:
    type: esp-idf  # Required
```

### NimBLE conflicts with other components

**Symptom**: Build errors about conflicting BLE configurations.

**Solution**: Remove incompatible BLE components (`esp32_ble`, `bluetooth_proxy`, etc.) or switch to Bluedroid stack.

### High memory usage despite using NimBLE

**Symptom**: Still running out of memory even with NimBLE.

**Solution**:
- Reduce logging level: `logger: level: WARN`
- Disable unnecessary features
- Use deep sleep to reduce runtime memory usage
- Check for other memory-intensive components

### NimBLE scan response limitations

**Symptom**: Device name or other scan response data not visible to receivers.

**Explanation**: NimBLE uses non-connectable advertising mode optimized for broadcast-only scenarios. Scan response data (which contains device name and ESPHome version) is only transmitted when a scanner actively requests it. Some receivers may not request scan response data from non-connectable advertisers.

**What's included in scan response**:
- Device name (Complete Local Name)
- ESPHome version (in Manufacturer Specific Data)

**What's NOT included** (to keep within size limits):
- Service UUID (already in main advertisement)
- TX Power Level
- Appearance

**Solution**: This is a protocol limitation, not a bug. The core BTHome sensor data is always in the main advertisement packet and will be received correctly. If device identification is important, ensure your receiver supports active scanning.

### NimBLE host task crashes

**Symptom**: "Guru Meditation Error" with stack trace showing `nimble_on_sync_` or `ble_hs_sync`.

**Solution**: Increase NimBLE host task stack size in your configuration:
```yaml
esp32:
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    sdkconfig_options:
      CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_HOST_TASK_STACK_SIZE: "8192"
```
